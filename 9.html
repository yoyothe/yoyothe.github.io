Yvngxchris:

yvngxchris is unlike your typical high school student. In comparison, many 16 years olds biggest problem is falling asleep in class or trying to get their license. Meanwhile, Chris is managing multiple viral tracks, working with A-list acts, and signing record deals at this same age. It is safe to say that he and his peers’ life is not the same. Moreover, the “Blood On The Leaves” MC is not letting any of this success get to his head. He creditsDre The Mayor,Pusha T, and his family for keeping him humble and focused. Although he channels out current POTUS in his latest viral smash, “B*tch I’m Joe Biden,” he makes rap fun again.
Columbia Records has had a fantastic couple of years. Their track record with viral artists lately has been remarkable. Creatives like 24KGoldn, Cochise, Chloe x Halle, and Lil Nas X call the label home. Now, yvngxchris will be next in line to blossom under their tutelage. Just this year, he has seen over 250K videos made to his tracks on TikTok. His YouTube page has millions of views, and he is just getting started. In our brief but impactful conversation, he discussed his early years in Virginia, experiences in the music industry, and plans for the rest of the year.
