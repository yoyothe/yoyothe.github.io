Yeat:
Born Noah Oliver Smith, on Feb. 26, 2000, the Portland rapper developed an early interest in music. Though he’s been releasing music since he was a teen, Yeat reached mainstream popularity in 2021 with the release of tracks like “Sorry Bout That” and “Money Twërk.” His starpower continued to rise to new levels with the release of “Gët Busy,” which went viral on TikTok. His continued attention online helped him earn a joint venture deal with Field Trip Recordings and Geffen Records.
Yeat’s most recent project, 2 Alivë, which dropped on Feb. 18, 2022 has already garnered positive critical reception. The 20-track project features guest appearances from Young Thug, Gunna, and more, and it debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.
